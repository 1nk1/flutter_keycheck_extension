## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:

- `feature/add-new-validation-rule`
- `fix/tree-view-refresh-issue`
- `docs/update-readme-examples`

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:

- `feat: add support for custom key patterns`
- `fix: resolve auto-completion performance issue`
- `docs: update installation instructions`
- `test: add unit tests for key scanner`

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run type checking
npm run compile
```

### Writing Tests

- Add unit tests for new features in `src/test/suite/`
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and error cases

Example:

```typescript
suite('KeyScanner Tests', () => {
  test('should categorize button keys correctly', () => {
    const scanner = new KeyScanner();
    const key = { name: 'loginButton', value: 'login_button' };
    const category = scanner.categorizeKey(key);
    assert.strictEqual(category, KeyCategory.Buttons);
  });
});
```

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update your fork:**

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes and commit:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: your descriptive commit message"
   ```

4. **Push to your fork:**

- **Screenshots:** Include before/after screenshots for UI changes
- **Testing:** Describe how you tested your changes
- **Breaking Changes:** Clearly mark any breaking changes

## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

```typescript
/**
 * Scans the workspace for testing keys
 * @param forceRefresh Whether to ignore cache and rescan all files
 * @returns Promise resolving to array of found testing keys
 */
async scanAllKeys(forceRefresh: boolean = false): Promise<TestingKey[]> {
    // Implementation
}
```

### File Organization

```bash
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extension.ts          # Main extension entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/              # Data models and interfaces
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/            # Business logic services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ providers/           # VS Code providers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/               # Utility functions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/               # Test files
```

### Code Quality

- Run `npm run lint` before committing
- Fix all TypeScript errors
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use meaningful commit messages

## Issue Guidelines

### Bug Reports

Include:

- VS Code version
- Extension version
- Flutter/Dart version
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Screenshots/logs if applicable

### Feature Requests

Include:

- Clear description of the feature
- Use case and motivation
- Proposed implementation (if any)
- Examples of similar features

## Development Tips

### Debugging

1. **Extension Host Debugging:**

   - Set breakpoints in your code
   - Press `F5` to start debugging
   - Use the Debug Console for logging

2. **Output Channel:**

   ```typescript
   const outputChannel = vscode.window.createOutputChannel('Flutter Testing Keys');
   outputChannel.appendLine('Debug message');
   outputChannel.show();
   ```

### Testing with Real Projects

1. Create a test Flutter project
2. Add various key usage patterns
3. Test all extension features
4. Verify performance with large projects

### Performance Considerations

- Use async/await for I/O operations
- Implement caching for expensive operations
- Debounce file change events
- Profile memory usage for large projects
